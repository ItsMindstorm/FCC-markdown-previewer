# The project
This is a project that I made as progress towards to the freecodecamp front development frameworks certification.

It is a project that provides random quotes which can be shared to social medias such as **X** and **Mastodon**   

## Features 
- Fast quote fetching, including author of the quote 
- Interactive buttons with which the quotes can be shared
